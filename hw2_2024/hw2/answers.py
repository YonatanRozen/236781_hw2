**Your answer:**

1. 
    a. The shape of the tensor is (64 , 512, 64, 1024). The jacobian of Y w.r.t X contains the derivatives of each 
    entry of Y w.r.t to each entry of X. This means that each entry of Y gives us a matrix of partial derivatives 
    which is the same shape as X. This is similar to when we calculated the derivative of cross entropy loss according 
    to X and the result was of the same shape as X. Since Y is a matrix of shape 64x512, and each entry is 
    translated to a matrix of shape 64x1024 (same size as X), we get a matrix of shape (64, 512, 64, 1024) which is a
    matrix of matrices. 
    
    b. The Jacobian is sparse. As we explained earlier, we differentiate each entry of y according to each entry in
        X. But each entry in Y is related to a specific sample (in fact, the entire row of that entry), so
         differentiating it according to any of the other 63 samples will produce 0. Thus, we have 63*1024 entries
        which are equal to 0, in every calculation in a specific cell in y, so we have 64*512*63*1024 0 entries in 
        the Jacobian which makes it sparse. 
        
    c. As written earlier in the notebook, we can calculate a specific entry in the gradient, 
    like \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1,1}} and than extrapolate from there how to obtain the VJP. 

2. 
    a. Similarly to what we explained in 1.a each entry in Y is differentiated w.r.t to each entry in W, 
       so the Jacobian dimensions will be (64, 512, 512, 1024).
       
    b. 

    c. As written earlier in the notebook, we can calculate a specific entry in the gradient, 
    like \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{1,1}} and than extrapolate from there how to obtain the VJP.

**Your answer:**

    backpropagation is indeed required for descent optimization. Neural networks typically include multiple 
    layers, so computing gradients of a layer according to inputs of previous layers directly might be 
    computationally expensive. Using backpropagation allows propagation
    of gradients using partial calculations from higher layers, which turns this process to more efficient.
